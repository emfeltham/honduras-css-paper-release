Separate models estimate for true and false ties. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. Estimates are presented from a minimal model that only adjusts for the stratified categories along with distance, a model with demographic controls (but no interactions), a model that interacts each control with kin status and relationship, and a model with all pairwise interactions. Generally, we observe that the estimates change only very little across each specification."
